<a id="notice" class="anchor" href="#notice" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notice</h2>

<p>I'm now studying in University of Waterloo so I won't update my projects a lot. Sorry if you are eager to see my projects - in which I'll be developing them when I finally get free time (either when I finished my homework - or when I start my co-op jobs). I would love to keep developing, and even collaborating with other developers, but I'm currently really, really busy.</p>

<h2>
<a id="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h2>

<p>Since github is for open source, the source code for all my projects below can be found on my github page.</p>

<h3>
<a id="squarejs" class="anchor" href="#squarejs" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>square.js</h3>

<p><strong>State: Abandoned</strong> - it was an old project and I found it inefficient to make a game engine in <code>JavaScript</code>.</p>

<p>A square-based game engine targeted at both traditional board games and RPG. An example of Chess using this game engine can be found on the <a href="http://danielzhu.tk/square.js">project page</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="rawscript" class="anchor" href="#rawscript" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RawScript</h3>

<p><strong>State: Abandoned</strong> - badly structured and too complex, so won't be able to continue developing.</p>

<p>A primitive but flexible little interpreter with support of customized scripting language.</p>

<h3>
<a id="joyfulcolours" class="anchor" href="#joyfulcolours" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>JoyfulColours</h3>

<p><strong>State: Suspended</strong> - until I find an alternate 3D engine, this game engine is way too slow using .NET's <code>Viewport3D</code>.</p>

<p>My biggest project yet - a 3D game engine written in <code>C#</code> that supports a variety of features. More descriptions available on github.</p>

<p>It was made out of scratch (well, with the support of .NET library), so complex features are not possible until I learn about them in other game engines (mainly Unity Engine) or about the algorithms concerning 3D rigging, etc.</p>

<h3>
<a id="birthland" class="anchor" href="#birthland" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Birthland</h3>

<p><strong>State: Completed</strong> - no longer in development. Future text adventure games will utilize a new engine.</p>

<p>A small text adventure game made as a birthday gift for my girlfriend Joy. It was written within about a week, so some features for more complex games are missing. The story <em>might</em> continue - I'm not sure if I will be writing a brand new story or what - but the engine itself is lacking features.</p>

<p>Note that the progress will <em>not</em> be saved. The game is short, and designed to be replayed, since it is really short, but your choices (especially your character) will affect the story and the ending.</p>

<p>I haven't uploaded the complete version, since it contains a private letter that I don't want to make public, and a 10M music file which is too big for an online version. The game without the extras can be played <a href="http://danielzhu.tk/birthland">directly online</a>. </p>

<h3>
<a id="what-about-the-other-projects" class="anchor" href="#what-about-the-other-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What about the other projects?</h3>

<p>Will be deleted soon - they are just temperarily here (for various reasons).</p>
