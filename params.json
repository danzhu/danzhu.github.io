{"name":"Daniel Zhu's Toolkit","tagline":"My open-sourced projects","body":"# Daniel Zhu's Toolkit\r\n\r\n## Notice\r\n\r\nI'm now studying in University of Waterloo so I won't update my projects a lot. Sorry if you are eager to see my projects - in which I'll be developing them when I finally get free time (either when I finished my homework - or when I start my co-op jobs). I would love to keep developing, and even collaborating with other developers, but I'm currently really, really busy.\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n\r\nSince github is for open source, the source code for all my projects below can be found on my github page.\r\n\r\n### square.js\r\n\r\n**State: Abandoned** - it was an old project and I found it inefficient to make a game engine in `JavaScript`.\r\n\r\nA square-based game engine targeted at both traditional board games and RPG. An example of Chess using this game engine can be found on the [project page](http://danielzhu.tk/square.js).\r\n\r\n### RawScript\r\n\r\n**State: Abandoned** - badly structured and too complex, so won't be able to continue developing.\r\n\r\nA primitive but flexible little interpreter with support of customized scripting language.\r\n\r\n### JoyfulColours\r\n\r\n**State: Suspended** - until I find an alternate 3D engine, this game engine is way too slow using .NET's `Viewport3D`.\r\n\r\nMy biggest project yet - a 3D game engine written in `C#` that supports a variety of features. More descriptions available on github.\r\n\r\nIt was made out of scratch (well, with the support of .NET library), so complex features are not possible until I learn about them in other game engines (mainly Unity Engine) or about the algorithms concerning 3D rigging, etc.\r\n\r\n### Birthland\r\n\r\n**State: Completed** - no longer in development. Future text adventure games will utilize a new engine.\r\n\r\nA small text adventure game made as a birthday gift for my girlfriend Joy. It was written within about a week, so some features for more complex games are missing. The story *might* continue - I'm not sure if I will be writing a brand new story or what - but the engine itself is lacking features.\r\n\r\nNote that the progress will *not* be saved. The game is short, and designed to be replayed, since it is really short, but your choices (especially your character) will affect the story and the ending.\r\n\r\nI haven't uploaded the complete version, since it contains a private letter that I don't want to make public, and a 10M music file which is too big for an online version. The game without the extras can be played [directly online](http://danielzhu.tk/birthland). \r\n\r\n### What about the other projects?\r\n\r\nWill be deleted soon - they are just temperarily here (for various reasons).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
