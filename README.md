# Daniel Zhu's Toolkit

## Notice

I'm now studying in University of Waterloo so I won't update my projects a lot. Sorry if you are eager to see my projects - in which I'll be developing them when I finally get free time (either when I finished my homework - or when I start my co-op jobs). I would love to keep developing, and even collaborating with other developers, but I'm currently really, really busy.

## Projects

Since github is for open source, the source code for all my projects below can be found on my github page.

### square.js

**State: Abandoned** - it was an old project and I found it inefficient to make a game engine in `JavaScript`.

A square-based game engine targeted at both traditional board games and RPG. An example of Chess using this game engine can be found on the [project page](http://danielzhu.tk/square.js).

### RawScript

**State: Abandoned** - badly structured and too complex, so won't be able to continue developing.

A primitive but flexible little interpreter with support of customized scripting language.

### JoyfulColours

**State: Suspended** - until I find an alternate 3D engine, this game engine is way too slow using .NET's `Viewport3D`.

My biggest project yet - a 3D game engine written in `C#` that supports a variety of features. More descriptions available on github.

It was made out of scratch (well, with the support of .NET library), so complex features are not possible until I learn about them in other game engines (mainly Unity Engine) or about the algorithms concerning 3D rigging, etc.

### Birthland

**State: Completed** - no longer in development. Future text adventure games will utilize a new engine.

A small text adventure game made as a birthday gift for my girlfriend Joy. It was written within about a week, so some features for more complex games are missing. The story *might* continue - I'm not sure if I will be writing a brand new story or what - but the engine itself is lacking features.

Note that the progress will *not* be saved. The game is short, and designed to be replayed, since it is really short, but your choices (especially your character) will affect the story and the ending.

I haven't uploaded the complete version, since it contains a private letter that I don't want to make public, and a 10M music file which is too big for an online version. The game without the extras can be played [directly online](http://danielzhu.tk/birthland). 

### What about the other projects?

Will be deleted soon - they are just temperarily here (for various reasons).
